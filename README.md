# Dermatological Disorder Classification

### Website Hosted At : http://dermatological-classification.herokuapp.com/

### This project is an  online tool that can tell doctors and lab technologists the three highest probability diagnoses for a given skin lesion. It could help them quickly identify high risk patients and speed up their workflow. The app will produce a result in less than 3 seconds. To ensure privacy, user submitted images are pre-processed and analyzed locally and are never uploaded to an external server. The app is able to classify 7 types of skin lesions.
